select function

It's easy to introduce clock skew by compiling on one machine,
copying the generated object code to another machine,
and rerunning the make utility on that other machine


Commands I used:
ifconfig <--- find the IP address of current machine 
nmap -sP 10.168.39.0/24 <--- Run a scan to see other machines on the LAN

The machine I used as a server had the IP address of 10.168.39.48
The machine I used as a client had the IP address of 10.168.39.49

Compiled and ran the make command in code/conc/
On the server, executed ./echoservers 9001
On the client, executed ./echoclient 10.168.39.48 9001

On the client I typed a few lines and pressed enter,
The server echo'd the response and listed the amount of bytes received
